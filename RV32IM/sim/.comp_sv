# All simulations require a "-L" parameter in order to load correctly
# the libraries during the simulation. A command line example is:
# vsim -L LPM work.tb_load_store
# vsim -L LPM work.tb_arithmeticologic
# vsim -L LPM work.tb_arithmeticologic_m
# vsim -L LPM work.tb_branch
# vsim -L LPM work.tb_instrMem
# vsim -L ALTMULT work.tb_load_store
# vsim -L ALTMULT work.tb_arithmeticologic
# vsim -L ALTMULT work.tb_arithmeticologic_m
# vsim -L ALTMULT work.tb_branch
# vsim -L ALTMULT work.tb_instrMem

# As this instruction expansion M has a variety of modules, here's required
# to select which one are being used. Between the two possible MUL modules;
# LPM_MULT is used at the MULDIV and ALTMULT_ADD is used at the MULDIV2, 
# so from here on forward, it will be mentioned which one is being used 
# when saying if is uses the MULDIV or the MULDIV2 module.
# To change which one is being used, at the "core_exe_stage.v" file it
# can be changed at line 118. In addition, is required to comment and 
# uncomment in this ".comp_sv" file which libraries are being loaded
# to set correctly the MULDIV or MULDIV2 module in use:

# Load IP Multifunction Libraries (change "QuartusPath" to your Quartus directory)
# Library created for compiling files required by LPM_MULT on the MULDIV
#vlib LPM
#vmap LPM LPM

# Another modules option is the DIV module. For this, change at the 
# MULDIV file being used ("core_execution_alu_m.v" for MULDIV or 
# core_execution_alu_m2.v for MULDIV2) and also at the "sv_files"
# comment and uncomment the required module.

# Load the project library
